       This app is inspired by the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flavor-Bible-Essential-Creativity-Imaginative/dp/0316118400/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top">The Flavor Bible</a> by Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg and is our entry for the <a href="http://neo4j-challenge.herokuapp.com/">Neo4j Heroku Challenge</a>.

       <p class="helptext">
       The concept is simple- the way ingredients in a great dish pair together based on their flavor affinity are modeled in a graph. The current version of this app captures flavor pairings and how well ingredients pair together, and then allows one to search by ingredient and view complementary combinations.

        <p class="helptext">
       To start, try searching for an ingredient. If the ingredient is in the database, then you will be rewarded with a visualization of pairings up to three levels deep. Click on each ingredient to see their respective pairings (if they exist).
